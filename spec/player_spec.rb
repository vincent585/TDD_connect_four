describe Player do
  # tests not needed as the class will only contain instance variables set in initialize method
end

# Player class will contain:
# - piece instance var
# - player num instance var

# Because I am not going to allow the player to choose their piece but rather assign one automatically,
# there is no need to write tests for this class as there will be no methods to test.
